# Voice Signal Processing with MATLAB

This project demonstrates the creation and analysis of a synthetic voice signal using MATLAB. It involves generating a composite signal, visualizing it in both time and frequency domains, and preparing it for further signal processing tasks.

## Overview

Voice signal processing is essential in applications such as speech recognition, audio compression, and noise reduction. In this project, we:

- Generate a synthetic voice-like signal
- Visualize the signal in the time domain
- Analyze the signal's frequency spectrum
- Save visual outputs for further documentation

## Tools & Environment

- MATLAB R2023a (or compatible version)
- No additional toolboxes required

## Files Included

- voice_signal_processing.m – main script for signal generation and visualization
- images/ – output screenshots from time and frequency domain
- report.pdf – project summary and result discussion (optional)
- README.md – project description and usage

## Output Samples

| Time Domain Signal | Frequency Spectrum |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| ![Time](images/voice_time.png) | ![Frequency](images/voice_freq.png) |

## How to Run

1. Open voice_signal_processing.m in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to generate and visualize the signal.
3. Use exportgraphics or MATLAB’s figure save option to store outputs.
